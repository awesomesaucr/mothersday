<center><h2>Why She's The Best Mom Ever</h2></center>
<a href="index.html">Home</a>

<center><h3>My mom has always put EVERYONE ahead of her. She has never wanted anything but for everyone in the world to live a nice and happy life.</h3>
  <h3>I promise you when I say you will never meet a woman that would do anything for anyone in need. Even when one of her kids were being as disrespectful as possible(never me of course...) she would always be there to help them whenever they needed it.</h3>
  <h3>As much as I may act like I don't care, or don't show that I care because I don't like hugs and things like that, I could not ask for a better mom or a better friend to have in my life, I live by that.</h3>
  <h3>Specific moments, like when we lived in Virgina, we didn't have "a lot" of money, but she still managed to get the Xbox for me, because she knew it would make me happy. She would do anything for her kids to make us happy, and we have absolutely taken that for granted... Which sucks cuz I never realized how good I really have it.</h3>
  <h3>Even looking back on other mother's day's, I have gotten her stuff before, but for the times I couldn't get her anyting, she was never upset with me. She would rather just spend time with her family then have to have anything really materialistic. She never asks anyone for anything. Just for the company of the person. Which I have (apologetically) been very bad at giving.</h3>
  <h3>You're the best mom in the whole world</h3>
