<h3>This tab is specifically made for the chance that my mom posts this site on facebook to show her friends or anything like that over Mother's Day weekend.</h3>
<h3>A big reason I came up with this idea is because I love coding. This whole site was self-coded by me alone. Like I said in the "Best Mom Ever" tab, I usually don't get a chance to really get anything for my mom, for Mother's Day. Or alternatively, I just don't know WHAT to get. But she has always told me to do what I love, and has had my back ever since I said I wanted to code for a living.</h3>
<h3>So, to show my real appreciation for that, I decided I want to code a website for her so she can see what I know how to do, and just see that I really appreciate her caring and backing me with everything that I've ever wanted to do. It always helps and means a lot to me, even though I rarely say that.</h3>
<h5>Something else to note is that I'm not just abandoning this site after Mother's Day weekend. I'm going to keep updating it, and making it look better as I learn more in coding. To show I'm learning and putting what I learn to use, and make my moms new little site look prettier.</h5>
<h5>Happy Mother's Day mom! You're the best!!</h5>
